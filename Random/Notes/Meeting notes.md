#### Connecting Cambodians to Canadian Projects
- Looking to find Cambodian companies to connect to, to bring Canadian work to Cambodia when I return. 


## About me
- Used to work in Canada as a project manager,
- Moved into self taught web development


Started a company with a friend
- Worked in Decentralized Fianance using a an app written in solidity to transfer stable coins 
- Built small internal apps for companies.


- Reason for wanting to bring work to Cambodia specifically
- I believe in equal opporrunity in the world. I feel as if a lot of cambodians are behind in this and it is limiting cambodia as a wholes role in the this global field. It seems to me to bring countries into first world postitions it would be to progress in this field, so If me bringing more work to cambodia would allow this that would be aligning myself with my beliefs. 
- I love working and the start up feel. I came from a company of 7 people and when I parted ways there was 45 people, So I understand some of the problems and pressures of scaling a company. Also the need for organization. I was the youngest project manager at my company at 24.

When I return goals

- Build a web development company 
- Work as a project manager/sales in Canada
- Connect with a Cambodian company to bring projects and income to cambodia. Also to use the income to train more cambodians in the tech field
- currently not needing an income but if I am doing billable work for a company I would expect payment. 

- I have 3 programmers who are very interesting in working with me on this project. 
	- One has a masters in computer science, and is working in freelance currentlyOne is working as a back end/dev ops developer in Holland, he is -  to canada in august to meet with me about future plans of him coming to Canada for work. 
	- One is a mechanical engineer who left engineering to learn more about the crypto world. 
	- I am more into company management, project management and I can do front-end work.

### TradesTek:

- Collaboration or developers. 
- There was a gap in the market - most field management is focussed towards either single company solution or residential work. 
- Means there is no sign up and go solution for this. Every company has to pick something and have deep intergration with the software
- Currenty these companies charge alot for these solutions. 
- I would like to tailor this kind of app to large commerical consturction. Giving very limited access to lower level employees
- Seeings how I came from this line of work as a project manager I noticed this missing feature. (A lot of trades workers are not capable of using these kind of apps, so they need something super simple on there end so that the managers can use it)
- With that being said, is this somehting that your team would be interested in building out with me, as a shared percentage? Otherwise what would the cost be let's say highering long term hourly?
