## Traps
> #ChessTip Don't play for traps, make moves that deploy your men in a way that helps your position generally
> - Don't make moves where your opponent doesn't see your trap and loses horribly
> - He sees your trap and counters in such a way that your position falls apart
> You can lay traps, as long as it doesn't hurt your position if they can counter-play the trap

# Chapter 3 - The Second Principle: Time

Time is defined as the ability to get to where you need to go faster than the opponent (not the time left on the clock)

>Don't rush attacks, wait unitil you can attack with all/most your pieces before going in
> Don't move a piece twice in an opening - unless you for sure gain more than you lose by not devloping another piece
