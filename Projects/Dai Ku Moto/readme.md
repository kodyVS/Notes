## About The Project

![[Pasted image 20210818222637.png]]

I built this project for a company called dai ku moto in cambodia who fixes and sells used motos. I used this time to practice and implement some best practices when it comes to working in front end development in a small easy to understand project. I tried to keep to using basic Vue functionailty instead of expanding into all the amazing (heavier) features Vue has.

The main areas I was able to solidify my knowledge
- Styles
	- SCSS structure
	- Positioning with floats, flexbox and CSS grid, 
	- Animations
	- General CSS Knowledge
	- Proper ways to address SVG's and icons
	- Responsiveness and mobile design
- Vue 
	- Working with the prototype model to manually create watched variables
	- Simple Optimization techniques
	- Using prebuilt components
	- Passing data between components effectivly
	- Event management
	- Different bundling options
	- Manually setting up variables to be watched
	- Created a svg libary to use (simple)
	- Lazy loading content
	- Working towards best practices in vue
- Overall Website design knowledge
	- Optimization of images inluding low quailty placeholders during load
	- Explored optimization techniques that didn't seem to work
	- How to catch user's attention
	- Using SEO in a SPA without SSR (nuxt)
	- Color pallete choices
	- Setting up universal variables for easy changes
	- Code struture for easy reuse
	- Front end design ideas
	- Browser and mobile support


This was my first project I didn't use a style package (boostrap, vuetify, etc ) and built most of the effects and animations myself. It was a great learning experience.
