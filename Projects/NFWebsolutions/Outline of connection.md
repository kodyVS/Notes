## MangoByte and NF Web Solutions Connection

### Big Picture Overview
- Keeping development in Cambodia
- Hiring developers in Canada to work in project management to organize and prepare jobs for Mangobyte to develop
- I would want to ensure that the work done would also be developing and training junior Cambodian developers

### Challenges
- Time difference
	- The best time for meetings would be starting at 4:00 AM for me, which would be 5:00 PM for you. 
	- I could also work at 8:00 PM, which would be 7:00 AM Cambodian time, although this could only be for an hour or two and not every day. I am more inclined to wake up early than work late.  

### Level of Integration Between the Two Companies?

Level 1

 - Separate entities
 - Have Mangobyte bid on projects
 - Profits would be solely the responsibility of each entity and not shared.

Level 2
 
 - Work together but still two separate entities 
 - Work on bids and quotes together. Split profits and losses by a percentage on the individual projects that we work on together
 - Profits would be job-specific
 
Level 3

- Mangobyte holds a stake in the Canadian company. 
- Work together with clients 
- Project managers to relay all projects with Mangobyte
- Growth and direction, and vision would be shared among both parties. 
- Possibly sharing on other international projects

Level 4

- I work for Mangobyte and start an office in Canada
- Profits would be shared at a percent + salary
- Vision and growth would be placed in Mangobytes Authority

## Moving Forward 

### Step 1: Get to Know Each Other
- While in Cambodia I would work in your office. During this time, my goals would be:
	- To lay the Canadian business groundworks (get everything ready for launch)
		- Website design and deployment
		- Logos and general company image
		- Client outreach techniques and solutions
		- SEO 
		- Social media
	- Work with your team on projects as a junior developer or junior project manager
		- Learn how you run your company and what timelines and workflow would look like
		- Learn how you connect with other countries
		- Build the working relationship and understanding.


From my point of view, I should be getting paid if I am doing work that is billable to a customer. So if I am working on a project and am able to contribute, I would expect payment for that time.


### Step 2: Pick a Direction

- After we get some experience together, we can figure out what solutions will work best for us to progress and how much involvement Mangobyte would like to have with NF Web Solutions as a Canadian partner. 


# Canadian Deployment
I want to give a quick summary about how I see the Canadian deployment happening. 

I would take a wage, and the rest of the profits would go to growing the Canadian company. I do not plan on making more than a livable salary for 5-10 years with profits being revested in the company. I can get by with a minimal salary of around 30,000 CAD in the first couple of years, but after that, I would need to start making somewhere between 80,000-100,000 CAD.

## Stage 1 Solo (1-2 Years)
### Employees
- 1-2 employees

#### Roles
- Client acquisition
- Project layout and requirements
- Connecting with Mangobyte and making sure requirements are fulfilled
- Quoting and pricing 
- Business setup and financial tracking.

### Work Acquisition
- Using my personal network
	- I am well connected in the trades and have many companies that need new technology
- Door to door
- Proper SEO 
- Networking conferences
	- Covid is pretty much a non-issue in Alberta now due to vaccine rollout, so conferences are happening again.

### Office
- Work from home or shared office space for minimal costs during start-up.

### Overhead Costs
- Year one for me could be as low as 30,000 CAD a year for salary, but the minimum salary moving forward would be aimed to be 80,000 CAD, which is an average developer salary in Canada.

## Stage 2 Growth (2+ Years)
### Employees
- 3-7 employees

### Work Acquisition
- Similar to the solo stage

### Employee Jobs
#### Project Managers 3-5 
- Manage new projects and customer requests
- Build workflow charts and project requirements
	- Programming experience would be required from this role
- Meet with Mangobyte developers to discuss project demands and needs.

#### Business Manager 1
- Also known as a financial controller - used to manage finances, payroll and profit/loss. Similar to an accountant.

#### Technical Support 1 
- Technical support during Canadian business hours.

#### Overhead Costs
- Office space would be needed
- Salary for Project managers
- Business manager/financial controller salary
- Tech support salary.

## Trades App

I will continue putting together a presentation for this app, including:

- Potential clients that are willing to work with me on it
	- Requirements from potential clients
- Work that has been done and the current state
- Work that would need to be completed to make it to version 1
- New features that will be required to make it to industry standard
- New features that will make the app better than the industry standard
- The market demand for this technology
- The market cap and competitors that are in the space.

If you are interested in joining the project by receiving a percentage of the profits/ownership, then I will continue to figure out the logistics behind building an idea of a contract. Otherwise, I will delay hiring until I can use personal income from NF Web Solutions to support the app's development, still using Mangobyte for development. Still, it would be considered a contract job with no profit sharing. 

## Questions for Mangobyte

- Does working together interest you?
- What levels of connection interest your company?
- If I were to start in the office, is there a project you could see me working on?
- Am I free to work in your office, or would you want me to wait until we have an agreement?
- Is there anything more you would like me to share with you before we continue?
