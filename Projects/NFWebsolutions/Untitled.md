## MangoByte and NF Web Solutions Connection

### Development in Cambodia
- Keeping development in Cambodia
- Hiring developers in Canada to work in project management and lead development
- I would want a specific amount of profits or work done to be developing and training new Cambodian web developers



### Challenges
- Time difference
	- The best time for meetings would be starting at 4:00AM for me, which would be 5:00PM for you. 
	- I could also work at 8:00PM which would be 7:00 AM Cambodian time, although this could only be for an hour or two
- Language barrier
	- Clients meetings might need to have translators with us. 


### How deep of a intergration of the two companies?
Level 1
 - Seperate entities
 - Have mango-byte bid on projects
 - Profits would only be based off of bid prices

 Level 2
 - Work together but still two seperate entities 
 - Work on bids and quotes together and split profits and losses by a percentage on the individual projects that we work on together
 - Profits would be job specific
Level 3
- Mangobyte holds stake in the Canadian company. 
- Work together with client's 
- Project managers to relay all projects with mango-byte
- Growth and direction and vision would be shared among both parties. 
- Possibly sharing on other international projects

Level 4
- I work for mangobyte and start an office in Canada
- Profits would be shared at a percent + salary
- Vision and growth would be placed in Mangobytes Authority

## Moving foreward 

Step 1: Get to know each other
- Setting up in your office for the next while. During this time I would
	- Lay the Canadian business groundworks (Get everything ready for launch)
		- Website design and deployment
		- Logo's and general company image
		- Client outreach techniques and solutions
		- SEO 
		- Social media
	- Working with your team on a project as a junior developer or junior project manager.
		- Learn how you run your company and what timelines and work flow would look like
		- Learn how you connect with other countries
		- Build the working relationship and understanding.


From my point of view, I should be getting paid if I am doing work that is billable to a customer. So if I am working on a project and am able to contribute I would expect some form of payment for that time.


Step 2: Pick a direction

- After some time we can figure out what solutons will work best for us to progress and how much involvement mangobyte would like to have with NF Web Solutions as a Canadian partner. 


# Canadian Deployment
I want to give a quick disscusion about how I see the Canadian Deployment happening 

I take a wage and the rest of the profits go to growing the company. I don't plan on making more than a livable salary for 5-10 years with profits going to revest in the company. First couple years I can get by with a minimal salary but after that I would need to start making somewhere between 80,000-100,000 CAD

## Stage 1 solo
### Employees
- 1-2 employees

#### Roles
- Client aquision
- Project layout and requirements
- Connecting with mangobyte and making sure requirements are fullfilled
- Quoting and pricing 
- Business set up and financial tracking.

### Work aquision
- Cold calling
	- I am well connected in the trades and have a lot of companies that need new technology. I am willing to cold call and set up meetings
- Door to door
- Proper SEO 
- Networking conferences
	- Covid is pretty much a non-issue in Alberta now so conferences will be postponed
- Possible Techniques mangobyte could share?

### Office
- Work from home or shared office space for minimal costs

### Overhead costs
- Year one for me could be as low as $30,000 CAD a year but minimum salary moving forward would be aimed to be $80,000 CAD which is an average developer salary in Canada

## Stage 2 Growth
### Employees
- 3-7 employees

### Work Aquision
- Similiar to solo although will have less of a focus

### Employee jobs
#### Project managers 3-5
- Manage new projects and customer requests. 
- Build work flow charts and project requirements
	- Programming experience would be requried from this role
- Meet with Mangobyte developers to discuss project demands and needs

#### Business manager 1 per 3-5 project managers
- Also known as financal controller - used to manage finiances, payroll and profit/loss. similar to an accountant.

#### Technical Support 1 Employee
- Technical support during canadian hours.

#### Overhead costs
- Office space would be needed
- Salary for Project managers
- Business manager/financial controller salary
- Tech support salary



## Trades App

I will continue putting together a presentation for this app including 
- Potential clients that are willing to work with me on it. 
	- Requirements from potential clients
- Work that has been done and the current state. 
- Work that would need to be completed to make it to version 1
- New features that will be required to make it to industry standard
- New features that will make the app better than industry standard
- The market that I am trying to break into
- The market cap and competitors that are in the space

If you we are interested in joining the project by receiving a percentage of the profits/ownership then we could continue, otherwise I think I will delay hiring until I can use personal income from the web development company to put towards the app's development, still using mango-byte for development, but it would be considered a contract job.
