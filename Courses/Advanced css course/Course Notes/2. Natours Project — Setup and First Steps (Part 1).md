## Clip Path - Polygon css 
Clip path polygon allows you to clip out an element into a specific shape
- Allows us to create custom shapes with css
- Clip-path let's us clip images
- Polygon works by selecting points to clip
- [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is a took that you can create custom shapes and copy the code #CSSResource
### HTML
  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <body>
      <header class="header">Some text...</header>
    </body>
  ```

### CSS

  ```scss
  .header {
  height: 95vh; //comment
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, #7ed56fc4, #28b485bb),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

  ```

# Background-position
- `Background-position` allows you to position a background where you want it to cut. 
- If you pick position `background-postion: top`, it will keep the top of the image and remove the bottom when it is clipped

# Building the Header - Part 2
## centering elements
 

  ```css
    .text-box {
    position: absolute;
    top: 40%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  }
  ```
- When using the CSS properties left and right, you are refering to the elements top-left location in relation to the parent object.
- When using transform: translate you are moving the element in relation to itself. so with that you are adjusting its reference point. When you use translate -50%, -50% you are moving the element's reference point to the center (top-left to center)

# Creating Cool CSS Animations

- Learn to create CSS animations using @keyframes and the animation proptery
- When using keyframes browsers are optimized for opacity and transform
- using @keyframes we can choose what happens at what percentage in our animation
- When calling out `animation` we can either set the individual properties of the animation as shown on `.heading-primary-main` or we can put all properties in the animation attribute. 
-  animation: `animation-name` : `animation-duration` : `animation-effect` <br>`animation: moveInBottom 0.5s ease-out 0.75s;`

##### CSS

 ```css
.heading-primary-main {
  display: block;
  font-size: 60px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 35px;
  animation-name: moveInLeft;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  /* animation-delay: 3s; */
  /* animation-iteration-count: 3; */
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;
}

.heading-primary-sub {
  display: block;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 17.4px;
  animation: moveInRight 1s ease-out;
}

@keyframes moveInLeft {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-100px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(10px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}
  ```
# Buiding a Complex Animated Button
## Transition all

`Transition: all .5s`  allows us to set a transition time or property to all animations/transitions on that element

  >#CSSTIP When building animations if there is a issue with a stutter at the end a fix is adding `backface-visibility: hidden;` #CSSHACK
