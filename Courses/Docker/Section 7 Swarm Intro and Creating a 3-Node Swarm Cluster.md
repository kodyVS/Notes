## Swarm Mode Built-in Orchestration
- How do we automate container lifecycle?
- How can we easily scale out/in/up/down?
- How can we ensure our contianers are re-created if they fail?
- How can w replace containers without downtime (blue/green deploy)?
- How can we control/track where containers get started?
- How can we create cross-node virtual networks?
- How can we store secrets, keys, passwords and get them to the right container (and only that container)?
